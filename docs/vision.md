# Product Vision & Roadmap

This project was built as a high-performance Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on backend engineering excellence. Below is the vision for how this tool evolves from an API into an enterprise-grade logistics platform.

## 🎯 Current Successes
- **Cost Minimization**: Proven reduction in fuel expenditure through algorithmic planning.
- **Resilient Geocoding**: High success rate even with ambiguous highway data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Dockerized and ready for cloud deployment (AWS/GCP).

## 🚀 The Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Real-time Context
- **Live Fuel Prices**: Integration with real-time fuel price APIs (instead of static CSV) to reflect the absolute latest market data.
- **Dynamic Traffic**: Adjusting route distances and fuel consumption based on real-time traffic congestion.

### Phase 2: Operational Constraints
- **ELD Integration**: Factoring in "Hours of Service" (HOS) for drivers. The system should plan stops where drivers can legally rest.
- **Vehicle Profiles**: Custom fueling profiles for different truck types, weights, and fuel efficiencies.

### Phase 3: User Interface
- **Fleet Manager Dashboard**: A React-based visualization tool to manage entire fleets and track realized savings versus projected costs.
- **Driver Companion App**: A simplified mobile interface for drivers to see their next planned stop on a map.

## 💡 Business Impact
By centralizing fuel decisions, a fleet of 50 trucks can save upwards of **$50,000 - $100,000 annually** just by capturing the $0.10-$0.20 per gallon differences that are currently lost to ad-hoc driver refueling.
